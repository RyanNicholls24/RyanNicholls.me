      "ID":"1", "Content": "The bay south of StormHaven has historically experienced record breaking winds causing extreme weather conditions. Some have attributed these conditions to more than just natural causes, but nobody has been brave enough to fully explore the bay during a storm. Because of these conditions sailors and other travelers would regularly moor in the northernmost section of the bay. Over time many of them decided it was a truly unique area and stayed there."
